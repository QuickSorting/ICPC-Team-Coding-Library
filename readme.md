Draft:

 **Must have** Can Consider (most likely useless actually) _If have time (ridiculous algorithms)_ ~~No need~~

## Polynomials

* **NTT multiplication**

* **Polynomial Inverse**

* Polynomial Exp, log, differentiation/integration, interpolation, multipoint evaluation, long division & modulo

* And/or/xor/subset convolution

* Stirling Numbers, bernoulli numbers

* ~~FFT with doubles, Polynomial multiplication mod 1e9+7~~

## Matching and Flow

* **Dinic** (with scaling?) and Min-cut

* **Min cost max flow**

* Bipartite Matching, MIS in Bipartite Graph

* General graph matching in O(n^3) or _O(msqrt(n))_

* _Stable Marriage_

* ~~Min cost graph matching~~ (very long)

* _Matroid intersection_ (I know nothing about it, not sure if it is good idea to template)

* _HLPP_ (faster flow algorithm than Dinic)

## Number Theory

* Modular int class (??? yes or no ???), **barrett reduction** (can copy from kactl)

* **Chinese Remainder Theorem** (with **extended gcd**)

* **Pollard Rho factorization** 

* **Miller rabin prime checker**

* Discrete log with BSGS (_or faster_)

* ~~Prime counting function in O(n^(2/3)/log^2n)~~

## Geometry

* Convex Hull :)))

* _Li chao_

* Voronoi

* Fraction class

* TODO

## Strings

* **Suffix array and LCP** (hard to write one with good constant)

* **Suffix Automaton** (can build suffix tree from it), ~~Ukkonen~~ (for evil setters forcing online or weird problems)

* **Palindromic Tree**, Manacher

* Hashing

* Aho Corasick

* Lyndon Factorization and minimum suffix/minimum cyclic rotation (i seldom see but its like 10 lines)

## Trees and DS

* Splay tree

* LCT

## Misc

* **A better random than rand()**

* A template to write custom hash functions for hash table

* Pbds

* **Big Integers** (not sure in what ways)

* _Gaussian Elimination friendly to precision_

* _Minimum Arborescence_

* Planar graph related algos
